# MeowSQL

MeowSQL is a database application that stores and retrieves data in CSV files. It includes a secure login system that prompts the
user to enter their username and password as command line arguments, and verifies the entered credentials against predefined credentials stored in the program. If the credentials are valid, 
the program displays a header for the database and allows the user to add, delete, and search for data through a user-friendly interface.
